#### P.S We know you are quite eager to contribute. But do check the general guidelines before rushing at the keyboard to code :bulb:

### General Guidelines for contribution 
* Always check if you are working on your develop-yourName branch. **Refrain yourself from making any contribution to main branch.**
* Always commit small chunks of code so that there is not a big loss in case your machine faces any issue.
* Before starting contribution, always pull the code form main branch using ```$ git pull origin master ```
* In case of any conflict and you are unable to resolve it, ping us we will try solving it together. 
* Write Clean commented code so that's easy for us to review. 
* For improving UI, add the screen shots in pull request. 

### We will be waiting eagerly for your contributions.
